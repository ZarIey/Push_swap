The Push swap project is a simple and effective algorithmic exercise: it involves sorting data.
You have at your disposal a set of integers, two stacks, and a set of instructions to manipulate them.
Write a C program named push_swap that calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest program, made up of Push swap language instructions, allowing to sort the integers passed as parameters.
